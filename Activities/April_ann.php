<h5><b>April Ann Trophy</b></h5><hr>

<p>One of the most awaited happenings of the department, it goes without

          saying we are all gearing up for it. It is an award given to the best

          'Out of the Box' design to one of the students of the department.

          Thomas Ibrahim, one of our esteemed alumnus, is the initiator and the

          sponsor of this award. The catch here is that the award accompanies a

          hefty cash prize along with a trophy.</p>

<font size="4">Here are a few points regarding the same :</font>

<ul>
              <li>The entry has to be a course work i.e, a submission made for any

          course but has to be a design based work. </li>
              <li>Judgement to be purely based on creativity.</li>
              <li>The winning entry can be a cow shed or a hospital. Both designs

          will face different sets of constraints which also differ in

          magnitude. But, this award is for that person who goes to the extent

          of breaking all constraints set on him. May be financial feasibility,

          functional standards, etc which are conventionally considered in a

          design.</li>
              <li>The submission of the entries would be anonymous and would analysed

          and judged for its 'out of the box'ness by the final year

          students.</li>
              <li>Finally, the aim of this award is to encourage students who come up

          with such creative ideas which differ from the usual. So that they do

          not give up on such ideas and continue to practise their designs and in

          future execute when they are in the field. This is to

          recognize them and help them go ahead with such work.</li>
